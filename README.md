# SBA Repay
Insight Data Science Project (Fall 2017, NYC).

I used loan report data for 1.5 million small business loans (SBA's 7a loan report) in conjunction with economic indicators (S&P 1500 index) to build a Random Forest classifier that predicts whether a loan will be paid in full or default. This is important so that Small Business Administration knows what kind of loans to provide guarantees for. It turns out that the state of the economy at the time a loan is awarded is more predictive of it defaulting than the type of the business it is given to.
